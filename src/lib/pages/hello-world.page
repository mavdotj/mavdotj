I finally have a blog! This is something I've always wanted to do but never really got around to doing it. I'll probably talk about goofy stuff here and I probably won't keep my typing very proper all the time, but this will be a good space for me to yap.

## About me
I've been programming since around 6 years old, when my older cousin @cornpop99 inspired me to start ~~being a nerd~~ programming. I've very much enjoyed the experience, I loved it so much I started teaching people myself (@hackclub). I honestly don't have any successful projects right now, but I run @ts-rex which is pretty cool I guess. I have no idea what to write about so bye love you thanks for reading!
